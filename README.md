# Utils-Mux-Autoplay

After spending a few hours on this, I've found a really nice way to setup the Mux Autoplayer to look good with autoplay.




## Features

- Mux Autoplay Disabled Controls using CSS Controls
- Proper Poster Alignments with Mux Video Player Default Video Position
- Example of MuxPlayer used as Background Video of Hero Section Component


## How To Use

Upload your video to Mux via API or directly on Mux website itself using the premade post request. Copy the playbackId and insert it in the HeroSection.tsx's Mux Player Section. 
Also include a thumbnail for the poster. I used [OnlineConverter](https://onlineconverter.com) to get the first frame of the video to be used as the thumbnail so that when the video loads it looks seamless to the user.



## Versions and Packages

```bash
  npm install @mux/mux-node@^9.0.1
  npm install @mux/mux-player-react@^3.1.0
```
